Examples
========

MSAT is distributed with several example scripts designed to 
illustrate the sort of calculation that can be perfomed 
using the toolkit. Source code and data files for the 
examples can be found in the /examples directory. The 
examples include:

* link:loading_examples.html[Example 1: Loading data]
* link:diopside_example.html[Example 2: Analysis of single crystal elasticity]
* link:texture_example.html[Example 3: Texture analysis and MTEX]
* link:lmm_anisotropy_example.html[Example 4: Lowermost mantle anisotropy]
* link:splitting_model_example.html[Example 5: Modelling shear-wave splitting variation with backazimuth]
* link:splitting_misfit_example.html[Example 6: Measuring splitting misfit and fitting elasticity from SWS measurement] 
* link:topotaxy_example.html[Example 7: Modelling texture inheritance between post-perovskite and perovskite]
