MSAT Release Notes
==================

Version 1.0.2 - unreleased / in progress
----------------------------------------

This version of MSAT includes several minor improvements, 
pieces of new functionality and bug fixes. Changes from 
1.0.1 are:

* Allow MS_expand to handle 9-element orthorhombic 
case.

* Add MS_save to write files in the formats supported 
by MS_load.

* Add a new TI parameterization 'global', which is like
'panning' but without the approximation of eta=1.

* Add options to produce nicer looking plots in MS_plot and 
allow contour limits to be set in MS_sphere.

* Include proper treatment of exactly parallel or perpendicular
layers in the stack of operators in MS_effective_splitting_N.

* Add new example showing the simulation of texture inheritance 
in the lowermost mantle.

Version 1.0.1 - 5 November 2012
-------------------------------

This version of MSAT collects together several minor improvements 
and minor bug fixes. Changes from version 1.0 are:

* Fix the 'reverse' argument of MS_sphere and MS_plot. This optional 
argument was inoperative.

* Clarify the behaviour of MS_rotEuler such that the default action is
to rotate the crystal and not the frame of reference. Add optional arguments
'sense', 'passive' to allow previous behaviour (rotation of the frame of 
reference)

* Add a new function MS_TI_parameters which calculates a range of 
values for VTI parameterisations given an elasticity matrix.

* Extend MS_sphere to plot slowness surfaces using 'slowP', 'slowS1' 
or 'slowS2' values for the mode argument.

* Speed up MS_phasevels by a factor of two.

* Expand the range of materials in MS_elasticDB

* Include reference to the MSAT paper ("MSAT - A new toolkit for the 
analysis of elastic and seismic anisotropy" Computers and Geosciences, 
49, pp.81-90. doi:10.1016/j.cageo.2012.05.031) in the documentation.

We thank Michele Zucali (University of Milan), Alan Baird (Bristol), 
Jenny Di Leo (Bristol), Nagaya Takayoshi (University of Nagoya) and 
an anonymous reviewer of the manuscript for contributing sugestions,
bug reports, and code.

Version 1.0 - 11 April 2012
---------------------------

This version of MSAT completes the intended initial feature 
set and contains more detailed documentation. There are 
also a few bug fixes, an API change (to MS_sphere's optional 
arguments) and a couple of new features. All users are 
encouraged to report outstanding bugs and request missing 
features. Major changes from version 0.9 include:

* The way MS_sphere handles optional 
arguments has been made consistent with
the rest of the code.

* The MSAT reference guide has been written
along with documentation on the various examples.
These release notes now form part of the documentation
available within the Matlab environment.

* A new function, MS_TI, has been written to bring together 
the various ways of creating a elasticity matrix with
transverse isotropy from the various representations. MS_VTI 
and MS_VTI2 now act as aliases to this function. Love's 
parameterisation has been added.

* Added new effective medium theories (for aligned cracks and 
thin layering) to MS_effective medium. Fixed a bug in the 
ellipsoidal inclusions case where the material parameters were 
provided as velocities rather than elasticity matrices.

* MS_phasevels has been made ~50% faster when called with 
a very large number of directions. The function also rejects 
invalid elasticity matrices (which, for example, can yield 
imaginary velocities).

Thanks to Alan Baird (Bristol) and Alex 
Cote (UCL) for reporting bugs in and 
suggesting improvements to version 0.9. 

Version 0.9 - 24 November 2011
------------------------------

This is the public beta version of 
MSAT with expanded documentation, 
new examples, some bug fixes and 
a few new functions. Users of version
0.8 are advised to upgrade. All users 
are encouraged to report bugs and 
request missing features. Major changes
from version 0.8 are:

* The way MS_plot handles optional 
arguments has been made consistent 
with the rest of the code. New 
optional arguments have been added. 

* An MSAT quick start guide has been 
added to the built-in and web based 
documentation. The full user guide 
has been started but is incomplete. 

* Six usage examples have been provided. 
They are located in subdirectories of 
the distributed examples directory.

* A new function, MS_poisson, has been 
added to evaluate Poisson's ratio for 
generally anisotropic materials as a 
function of strain direction.

* A new function, MS_VTI2, has been added 
to generate an elasticity matrix with 
hexagonal symmetry from the vp, vs, xi, 
phi and eta parameters sometimes used 
in global tomography.

* Provide a work around for Matlab version 
dependent compatibility issue in MS_checkC.

Version 0.8 - 4 October 2011
----------------------------

This is the first version of MSAT 
so there are no backwards incompatibility 
issues.  However, this is an alpha 
release and note that:

* Elastic constant interpolation for 
  trigonal symmetry does not work correctly.
* Several examples are incomplete. 
* Many of the functions are derived from 
  older "CIJ_" code. Argument orders and 
  details of what must be passed have been 
  freely changed. Do read the documentation.
